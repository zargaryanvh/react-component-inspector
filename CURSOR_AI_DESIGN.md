# Designed by Cursor AI

This entire project was fully designed and developed using [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), an AI-powered code editor.

## What This Means

Every aspect of this project was created through AI-assisted development:

- **Architecture**: The component structure, context design, and utility organization
- **Code**: All TypeScript/React code, hooks, components, and utilities
- **Documentation**: README, guides, API documentation, and examples
- **Project Setup**: package.json, tsconfig.json, .gitignore, and build configuration

## The Development Process

1. **Initial Concept**: The idea for a component inspection tool
2. **AI-Assisted Design**: Cursor AI helped design the architecture
3. **Implementation**: All code written with AI assistance
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docs created with AI
5. **Refinement**: Iterative improvements through AI collaboration

## Why This Matters

This project demonstrates:

- **AI Capability**: What's possible when AI and developers collaborate
- **Quality**: AI can produce production-ready, well-documented code
- **Speed**: Rapid development through AI assistance
- **Innovation**: New tools created through AI-human collaboration

## The Result

A fully functional, production-ready React component inspection tool that:
- Works seamlessly in development
- Provides zero overhead in production
